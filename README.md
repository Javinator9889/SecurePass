## Active branches

Currently the active branch is the **[development](https://github.com/Javinator9889/SecurePass/tree/development)** one, and there will be more branches when needed (for example, *developing JavaDocs, database, etc*).

## If you are following this project...

... and you would like to help, you can just revise the code I wrote and open issues with errors you found **always following the [issue template](https://github.com/Javinator9889/SecurePass/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md)** so I can solve errors fastly :)
